# APIproject
This project aims to display the skill of utilizing API's interactively within a web app, by dynamically creating interactive nature gifs. To do this, we looked to find a way to incorporate the giphy API into an app that was fun to play around with, as well as easy to use. I began by researching how to modify an API request to include diferent query values. A large component of the project also consisted of making dynamically created elements using DOM manipulation with JQuery. I then researched how to use diiferent queries to effectively pause and play a gif. 

I also looked into some design elements to make a more visually enjoyable app. The result is a basic app that is fun to play around with, and demonstrates my ability to make API calls and dynamically create elements. See the deployed version here  https://nick-haer.github.io/APIproject/
